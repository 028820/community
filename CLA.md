# The Contributor License Agreement

The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][CNCF] defines the legal status of the
contributed code in a _Contributor License Agreement_ (CLA).

Only original source code from CLA signatories can be accepted into kubernetes.

This policy does not apply to [third_party] and [vendor].

## How do I sign?

#### 1. Read

  * [CLA for individuals] to sign up as an individual or as an employee of a signed organization.
  * [CLA for corporations] to sign as a corporation representative and manage signups from your organization.
  
#### 2. Sign in with GitHub.

Click
  * [Individual signup] to sign up as an individual or as an employee of a signed organization. 
  * [Corporation signup] to sign as a corporation representative and manage signups from your organization.

Either signup form looks like this:

#### 3. Enter the correct E-mail address to validate!

Your github email address __must match__ the same address you use when signing the CLA.

The address entered in the form must meet two constraints:
 
 * It __must match__ your  [git email] (the output of `git config user.email`)
   or your PRs will not be approved!

 * Use `git config user.name "Mona Lisa"` and `git config user.email "mona@example.com"`
   to ensure you've set this properly.

 * It must be your official `person@organization.com` address if you signed up
   as an employee of said organization.

 * If you've already submitted a PR you can correct your user.name and user.email 
   and then use use `git commit --ammend --reset-author` and then `git push` to 
   correct the PR.  

 * Github has [documentation] on setting email addresses.

#### 4. Look for an email indicating successful signup.

> The Linux Foundation
>
> Hello,
>
> You have signed CNCF Individual Contributor License Agreement.
> You can see your document anytime by clicking View on HelloSign.

Once you have this, the CLA authorizer bot will authorize your PRs.
