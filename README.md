# Kubernetes Community

Welcome to the Kubernetes community!

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the Kubernetes community - improving docs, improving code, giving talks etc.

## Communicating

The [communication](communication.md) page lists communication channels like chat,
issues, mailing lists, conferences, etc.

For more specific topics, try a SIG.

## SIGs

Kubernetes is a set of projects, each shepherded by a special interest group (SIG).

A first step to contributing is to pick from the [list of kubernetes SIGs](sig-list.md).

A SIG can have its own policy for contribution,
described in a `README` or `CONTRIBUTING` file in the SIG
folder in this repo (e.g. [sig-cli/CONTRIBUTING](sig-cli/CONTRIBUTING.md)),
and its own mailing list, slack channel, etc.

If you want to edit details about a SIG (e.g. its weekly meeting time or its leads),
please follow [these instructions](./generator) that detail how our docs are auto-generated.

## How Can I Help?

Documentation (like the text you are reading now) can
always use improvement!

Each [kubernetes project](http://git.k8s.io) subrepository (including this one!) has issues that are labeled "help-wanted", "good first issue" or similar that should not need deep knowledge of the system. For example, here are [help wanted] issues for the main Kubernetes repository.

To dig deeper, read a design doc, e.g. [architecture].

[Pick a SIG](sig-list.md), peruse its associated [cmd] directory,
find a `main()` and read code until you find something you want to fix.

## Learn to Build

Links in [contributors/devel/README.md](contributors/devel/README.md)
lead to many relevant technical topics.

## Contributing

The [Contributor Guide](contributors/guide/README.md) provides detailed instruction on how to get your ideas and bug fixes seen and accepted, including:
1. How to [file an issue]
1. How to [find something to work on]
1. How to [open a pull request]
