 <h1>Upstream Marketing Blog Guidelines</h1>

Blogging serves as a way to highlight and give exposure to the work that is being done by the kubernetes [community].

<h2>Guidelines for contributor blogs: </h2>

* Use inclusive language understandable by everyone
* Stay on topic and stick to the facts
* Avoid interjecting personal reactions 
* Shy away from jargon and colloquial expressions
* Revise your post before submission to make sure it’s unambiguous and accurate
* Emphasize the things you want readers to remember; tell a story
* Provide evidence and data where applicable, to back up your message
* As the author, never talk about your employer, sell, promote, or pitch; this is about upstream community endeavours and the individuals+groups that create it.
* Avoid ambiguity
* Avoid including anything that lacks adequate evidence
* Make sure to have at least one original quote and one picture
* Much of what’s outlined already in the [website blog guidelines] owned by sig-docs

<h2>Blogger Expectations, Responsibilities, and Info</h2>

1. Active bloggers should write one blog a quarter. The time commitment is typically 5-10 hours per quarter depending on the number of blog posts in the review queue.

3. Bloggers are expected to attend at least one upstream marketing team meeting a month or check-in to remain active.
