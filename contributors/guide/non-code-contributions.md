New contributors welcome!

*   Plan of attack
    *   Identify Non-Dev focused roles
        *   Tasks tied to these roles
        *   Examples:
            *   Technical project leadership
                *   SIG contribution
            *   Leading contributor communities
            *   Promotion of people and projects
                *   Recognition
            *   Managing communication tools
                *   Zoom, Slack, Discourse, ...
            *   Writing articles/blogs
                *   Capture it somewhere, not sure where yet
                *   Feed into Kube.weekly?
            *   Creating artwork
                *   Conference specific, project specific
            *   Answering questions from community members
            *   Updating documentation
                *   "Everybody owns docs" can equal "nobody owns docs"
                *   Strengthen the entry point for doc ownership
                *   Get specific enough so that someone would have an entrypoint to get started and take ownership
                *   Funneling more people to SIG-Docs
            *   Operations or "Tech" that is generally not considered "dev"
                *   e.g. ansible
            *   This! (Onboarding and enabling new people)
                *   You only get one chance to see this onboarding process for the first time, so a steady stream a fresh eyes is important.
        *   Let's just ask the SIGs!
        *   Chat with Paris regarding alternate entry paths, as may have come up during mentoring efforts.
        *   Follow up on Contrib-Ex call
    *   Identify Non-Dev tasks in primarily Dev roles
        *   Is it a dis-service to suggest Docs are Non-Dev?
            *   New functionality vs Updates/common documentation
