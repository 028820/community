# 2018 Kubernetes Contributor Summit US

This event brings together new and current Kubernetes contributors to connect and share face-to-face. It is an opportunity for existing contributors to help shape the future of community development and offers a welcoming space for new community members to learn, explore and put the contributor workflow to practice.
The summit now spans two days; including an optional social event in the early evening of December 9th along with the main full-day event December 10th.

In some sense, the summit is a real-life extension of the community meetings and SIG meetings. There are three explicit goals:

- Cross-SIG communication and announcements
- Onboard new contributors to be productive in our community
- Send contributors home with more context, knowledge, and skills about the project

## Registration
