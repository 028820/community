# 2019 Kubernetes Contributor Summit EU

## What

This event brings together new and current Kubernetes contributors to connect and collaborate face-to-face. It is an opportunity for existing contributors to help shape the future of the project, and offers a welcoming space for new community members to learn, explore and put the contributor workflow to practice. The summit spans two days - an optional social event in the evening of Sunday, May 19th along with the main full-day event on Monday, May 20th.

In some sense, the summit is a real-life extension of the community meetings and SIG meetings. There are three explicit goals:

 - Onboard new contributors to be productive in our community
 - Send contributors home with more context, knowledge, and skills about the project
 - SIG-specific face-to-face collaboration
