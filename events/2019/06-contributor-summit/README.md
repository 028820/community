## Description

This year's contributor summit in China will be a full-day event for people who contribute to Kubernetes, or are interested in becoming contributors, whether through writing code, documentation, infrastructure, project management, or the many other places they can help.  It will include three tracks:

* The New Contributor Workshop is for those looking to find out how to become Kubernetes contributors;
* The Current Contributor Day is for attendees who are already contributing to Kubernetes, and want to learn more or do hands-on work at the Summit;
* The Documentation Sprints are for community members who want to help with writing documentation or translating it.

## New Contributor Workshop

The New Contributor Workshop is a 5-hour long tutorial, with participatory exercises, that covers the basics of contributing to Kubernetes and being part of its community.  It is not possible to attend only part of the workshop, and you are expected to stay for the whole day.

Attendees will be expected to bring a laptop, sign the Contributor License Agreement, and have a GitHub account.  The workshop will be held in both Chinese and English, with live translation.

## Current Contributor Day

This day is for people who already contribute to Kubernetes and participate in its community and want a place to have working meetings, as well as contributors who have already taken the New Contributor Workshop and want to learn more in-depth contribution topics.

Sessions during this day will be arranged by the community, and as such a final schedule will be posted here in early June.

The Contributor Day will be held primarily in English, although one or two sessions may be in Chinese.


## Documentation Sprints

The Documentation Sprints are for community members who want to help the project by either writing original documentation, updating and improving our documentation, or by translating the existing documentation into Chinese and other languages.  

Attendees must have some proficiency in written English, should bring laptops, and should sign the Kubernetes CLA.
