# 2018 VOTERS GUIDE - KUBERNETES STEERING COMMITTEE ELECTION

## Purpose

The role of this election is to fill out the three (3) seats due for
reelection this year on the [Kubernetes Steering Committee]. Each elected
member will serve a two year term.

## Background

This election will shape the future of Kubernetes as a community and project.
While SIGs and WGs help shape the technical direction of the project, the
[Steering Committee Charter] covers the health of the project and community
as a whole. Some examples of responsibilities to consider as you are deciding
whether to run or who to vote for:

- Define, evolve, and defend the vision, values, mission, and scope of the
  project.
- Define and evolve project governance structures and policies, including how
  contributors become committers/maintainers, approvers, reviewers, members,
  etc.
- Charter and refine policy for defining new community groups (including
  Special Interest Groups, Working Groups, and Committees), and establish
  transparency and accountability policies for such groups

For more context, please see the [current steering committee backlog] or a
previous [governance meeting video] which led to this whole process.
