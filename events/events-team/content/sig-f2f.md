# SIG Face-to-Face Handbook

## Overview

The SIG Face-to-Face (F2F) Lead recruits, selects, and schedules "face-to-face" sessions run by each SIG, WG, or Team.  F2Fs are open-form discussion sessions, usually structured as SIG meetings, but sometimes task-based or topic-based discussions.  The F2F lead does not select topics or activities for the F2F sessions, except making sure that they *have* a topic or activity.
