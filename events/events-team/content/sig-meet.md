# SIG Meet & Greet Handbook

## Overview

The SIG Meet & Greet lead recruits and arranges staffing for a session at the Summit for contributors to meet up with SIG approvers or representatives, both to allow new contributor to select a SIG the want to participate in, and for current contributors to chat with SIGs about outstanding work.  The Meet & Greet may involve a "bring your own PR" exercise as well, in which case the lead ensures that attendees and SIGs are prepared for it.
