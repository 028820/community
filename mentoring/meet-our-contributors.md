# Meet Our Contributors - Ask Us Anything! 
*This doc is a work in progress*

When Slack seems like it’s going too fast, and you just need a quick answer from a human...

Meet Our Contributors gives you a monthly one-hour opportunity to ask questions about our upstream community, watch interviews with our contributors, and participate in peer code reviews.

## When:
Every first Wednesday of the month at the following times -
* 03:30pm UTC [calendar link](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MGw2OHM5bGRranJwZjI3OHN1MTk2Y2pjYjggcGFyaXNwaXR0bWFuQGdvb2dsZS5jb20&tmsrc=parispittman%40google.com)

## Submitting a question:
Day of on twitter - use #k8smoc   
Slack - [#meet-our-contributors](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/meet-our-contributors)

## Submitting a code snip / PR for peer code review:
24 hours beforehand to slack channel

Questions will be on a first-come, first-served basis. First half will be dedicated to questions for contributors and the second half, we will pick a problem (in advance) for peer code review. Problems will be picked based on time commitment needed, skills of the reviewer, and if a large amount are submitted, need for the project. 




### TODO
Update with link to google form (or some other submission method) for collecting peer code review problems
