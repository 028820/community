participate in peer code reviews.

## When:

## What You'll Gain By Participating:

* An opportunity to learn more about how to get started contributing to K8s
* A chance to get your PRs reviewed by members of the community
* Peer code review that can help you get more eyes on your code, or learn more
about a part of the Kubernetes code that may have you struggling
* A deeper understanding of the unique role that our contributors occupy in the
Kubernetes ecosystem as a whole
* Practical advice and hands-on tips for how you can get started as a Kubernetes
contributor, become a member, or otherwise contribute to the project

## What’s on-topic:
* How our contributors got started with k8s
* Advice for getting attention on your PR
* GitHub tooling and automation
* Your first commit
* kubernetes/community
* Testing

## What’s off-topic:
* End-user questions (Check out [#office-hours] on Slack and details [here])

## Submitting questions and/or code for review/walk through:
### Questions:
* Day of on Twitter - use the hashtag [#k8smoc] after your question   
* Slack - Ask your question in #meet-our-contributors

Questions will be on a first-come, first-served basis. The first half of the discussion will be dedicated to questions for contributors and in the second half, we will pick a problem (in advance) for peer code review.

### Code snip / PR for peer code review / Suggestion for part of codebase walk through:
* At least 24 hours before the session to Slack channel (#meet-our-contributors)

Problems will be chosen based on time commitment needed, the skills of the reviewer, and if a large amount are submitted, need for the project.

## Call for Mentor Panelists!

Expectations of mentors:
* Be online 5 minutes early. You can look at questions in the queue by joining the #meet-our-contributors Slack channel to give yourself some time to prepare.
* Expect questions about the contribution process, membership, navigating the Kubernetes seas, testing, and general questions about you and your path to open source/Kubernetes. It's okay if you don't know the answer!
* We will be using video chat (Zoom, but livestreaming through YouTube) but voice-only is fine if you are more comfortable with that.
* Be willing to provide suggestions and feedback to make this process & experience better!


## Host Instructions
TODO: elaborate here and upload example comms

Want to host in another timezone? Reach out to us on the #sig-contribex slack
channel!
0. Recruit a live streamer from sig-contribex
1. Recruit panelists (3-4) that represent a mix of backgrounds, sigs, and experience
levels. Look to devstats contributor dashboards for most recent releases to get
folks who are active in the project. You don't want all of the same voice; please
make this as diverse as possible.
2. Send panelists the zoom link calendar invite and a prep email. Tell the panelists
to help advertise on the mailing lists and networks.
3. Advertise. Send a note to k-dev, request a tweet from social@cncf.io, post in
#k-dev, #meet-our-contributors, and #sig-contribex slack channels
4. Confirm with everyone a few days before. We always have at least one person that
can no longer accommodate with their schedules and will need a back up or know
that you will be one less.
5. Tweet and get the word out in the AM (ask others to tweet for you!) of the show
6. Have panelists meet 5 minutes early for the streamer to test audio.
7. While testing, go over the agenda for the panelists, give them a chance to ask
questions, also give them a heads up on questions that have already come through
so they can think of responses a head of time.
8. Start the show!
9. Show agenda:
- Welcome to x month's Meet Our Contributors!
- Intro yourself (brief, name usually and that you are the host)
- We have a code of conduct! ... talk about where to find it, be excellent across
x platforms, if someone needs to report conduct@kubernetes.io
- Go over instructions on how to ask questions and panelists can ask each other
questions
- State: "Our agenda today as always: intros, announcements, and q&a!"
- Ask panelists to do introductions (no order, just call out names). They can take
up to 5 minutes if they go into their background.
- Converse freely with the panelists so its not boring Q&A. As host should only
answer a question if other panelists are done or no one has a response.
