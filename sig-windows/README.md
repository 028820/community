## Getting Started

If you're new to running containers on Windows, you can get started at http://aka.ms/windowscontainers . 


The documenation for Kubernetes on Windows is in a state of flux until v1.9 is released. At 1.9, the [Getting Started Guide on kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/windows/) originally written for v1.5 will be replaced with updated steps. Until then, multiple guides are available for setting up Kubernetes nodes on Windows:

* (draft) [v1.9 Getting Started guide](https://deploy-preview-5978--kubernetes-io-master-staging.netlify.com/docs/getting-started-guides/windows/)
* Using host gateway: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/kubernetes/getting-started-kubernetes-windows 
* Using OVN as demonstrated at Google Cloud Next '17: https://github.com/apprenda/kubernetes-ovn-heterogeneous-cluster
