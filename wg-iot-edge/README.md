## Goals

* Provide reference architectures for various IoT/Edge environments.
* Create and maintain conformance tests tailored towards performance and reliability requirements of the most popular IoT/Edge use cases.
* Build end-to-end PoCs to validate overall design and provide examples to system integrators.
* Evaluate and possibly extend k8s federation and network infrastructure to better suite IoT/Edge use cases over bandwidth constrained and unreliable WAN interconnects.
* Evaluate and possibly improve connectivity and data ingestion options to better support various field protocols.
* Evaluate and extend existing CLI tools to manage k8s clusters running in remote edge locations.
